      <p>The hardware that LibraryBox runs on is the TP-Link MR3020 Wireless N router, available from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/TP-LINK-Portable-802-11n-Wireless-TL-MR3020/dp/B006DEBXD0/?tag=jasongriffey-20">Amazon</a> or <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833704127&Tpk=tp-link%20mr3020">Newegg</a> for only $36.99.</p>
       
       <p> The MR3020 runs on standard 5V USB power, and can be powered by anything that outputs standard USB power. In fixed installations, this can be a standard USB wall plug that is plugged into an outlet, any powered USB hub, or a USB port on a computer.</p>
       
       
<p>If you want to run your LibraryBox from battery, in order to make it mobile, any battery pack with a USB port will power the MR3020, it's just a matter of how long you want it to run. In my tests, a 6600 mAh battery pack designed for the iPad ran the MR3020 for over 15 hours.</p>

<h2>Battery Choices</h2>

<p>
Given my entirely unscientific tests, the run time above means that LibraryBox draws about .4 watts. Given that, here's a chart of approximate runtimes for a variety of the most popular rechargeable battery packs.</p>

<h3>Different routers</h3>
<p>LibraryBox is built on top of two other pieces of software: OpenWRT and Piratebox. In theory, anything that runs PirateBox should be capable of being turned into a LibraryBox. In practice, it's not quite that easy. </p>
<p>However, there is one other primary candidate for LibraryBoxing, and that's another TP-Link product, the WR703N. According to those in-the-know, the chipset and board are identical to the MR3020, just redesigned for the non-US market. It does require a <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr703n-v1-squashfs-factory.bin">slightly different OpenWRT build</a>, but is much smaller (almost half the size of the MR3020) and uses micro-USB for it's power (slightly more common, given that it's the standard for cellular chargers outside the US). 
</p>
<p>I have a WR702N supposedly winging its way to me from Hong Kong, and will report as to how the LibraryBox conversion goes.</p>
<h3>Alternate Power Sources</h3>
<p>There has been a considerable amount of interest in how to put together a free-standing LibraryBox that is self-sufficient for its power needs. In the US, this typically means solar panels with battery backup, although theoretically you could run a LibraryBox from a generator driven by wind or water power. 
</p>
<p>
Solar power is highly dependent on location, and where the solar panels are, their angle, and how clean they are kept are all factors in how well a solar setup could work. Here are a few solutions, ranging from dead simple to moderately complex.</p>
<p>One way to go would be to try an out-of-the-box solar system designed for USB devices, like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Instapark%C2%AE-Portable-Charger-Compatible-Included/dp/B006ZSFH6I/?tag=jasongriffey-20">Instapark 10 Watt Solar Panel Portable Solar Charger</a>. It's cheap as these things go, but as it's designed to be portable I'm not sure how well it would work as a fixed installation. But for "take your LibraryBox to Bonnaroo" off-the-grid action, it might be a very nice solution. 
</p>
<p>There is another out-of-the-box option for this, based around the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/External-Universal-High-Efficiency-Smartphones-E-readers/dp/B008187COU/?tag=jasongriffey-20">Revive Solar Restore XL</a> combined with the add-on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Charging-Extensions-ReStore-External-compatible/dp/B008I64E64/?tag=jasongriffey-20">solar panel extensions</a>. The Restore XL is a 4000 mAh battery, and according to the Amazon spec sheet the add-on panels will recharge the battery with 4.5 hours of direct sunlight. Since the 4000 mAh should give you about 9 hours of runtime for the MR3020, as long as you can get better than 50% direct sunlight you should stay ahead of the power curve. For under $100, it's got potential as a solution.
</p>

<p>Another option would be to design a system based around the common 12 volt battery, and build a system to charge, and then to step the voltage down to 5V USB. Something like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Instapark%C2%AE-Black-Mono-crystalline-Charge-Controller/dp/B005LR9IOG/?tag=jasongriffey-20">Instapark 10W Mono-crystalline Solar Panel with 12V Solar Charge Controller</a>, combined with <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/UPG-UPG-D5744-SLA-BATTERY-12V-12AH-F1-TERMINALS-UB12120-/120948253194?forcev4exp=true#ht_3708wt_1277">some cheap 12 Volt batteries</a> and a <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/iSimple-12-Volt-Battery-5-Volt-USB-Charger-IS43-/290720674580">12 Volt to 5 Volt convertor designed for motorcycle use</a> should work. All together, it's not much more expensive than the above options, and is far more powerful.
</p>
<p>I have not tried any of the solar solutions above...these are just first-blush guesses at what might work. If you are interested in this sort of LibraryBox installation, please let me know, I'd love to know what you're planning!</p>
